<p><br><br>Details of Sherlock holmes's life in Conan Doyle's stories are scarce and often vague. Nvertheless, mentions of
    his early life and extended family paint aloose biographical picture of the detective.
    <br><br>Holmes says that he first developed his methods of deducation as an undergraduate; his earliest 
    cases, which he pured as an amateur, came from fellow university students. A meeting with a classmate's 
    father led him to adopt detection as a profession.
    <br><br>it was worth a wound. it was worth many wounds; to know the depth of loyalty and love which
    lay behind that cold mask. the clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm limps were 
    shaking. For the one and only time i caught a glimse of a great heart as well as of a great brain. All my
    years of humble but single-minded service culminated in that moment of revelation.
    <br><br> To sherloch holmes she is always a woman. i have seldom heard him mention her under any other name.
    In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. it was not that he felt any emotion  skin 
    to love for Irene Adler... and yet there was but one woman for him, and the woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious
    and questionable memory.
    <br><br>it is simplicty itself... my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight
    strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone
    who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from him. Hence,
    you see, my double deducation that you had been out in ville weather, and that you had a particulary
    malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey.
    <br><br> Though Holmes is fames for his reasoning capabilities, he investigate technique relis heavily
    of the acquisition of hard evidence. Many of the techniques he empoloys in the stories were at the time 
    in their infancy.
    <br><br>Had been drinking his beer in the tap-room. and had heard the whole conversation. Who was I? 
    what did I want? what did I mean by asking questions? He had a fine flow of language, and his adjectives
    were very vigorous. He ended a string of abuse by a  vicious backhander, whick i failed entirely avoid.
    the next few minutes were delicious. it was a straight left against a slogging ruffian. i emerged as you see
    me. Mr.Woodley went home in a cart.</p>
